            <h1>Understanding RSA Algorithm</h1>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <p>RSA algorithm is a public key encryption technique and is considered as the most secure way of encryption. It was invented by Rivest, Shamir and Adleman in year 1978 and hence name <b>RSA</b> algorithm.</p>
            <h2>Algorithm</h2>
            <p>The RSA algorithm holds the following features −</p>
            <ul class="">
                <li><p>RSA algorithm is a popular exponentiation in a finite field over integers including prime numbers.</p></li>
                <li><p>The integers used by this method are sufficiently large making it difficult to solve.</p></li>
                <li><p>There are two sets of keys in this algorithm: private key and public key.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>You will have to go through the following steps to work on RSA algorithm −</p>
            <h3>Step 1: Generate the RSA modulus</h3>
            <p>The initial procedure begins with selection of two prime numbers namely p and q, and then calculating their product N, as shown −</p>
            <pre class="">N=p*q
            </pre>
            <p>Here, let N be the specified large number.</p>
            <div>
                <label>P : </label>
                <input type="number" id="p" style="height: 30px;"></input>
                <br>
                <label>Q : </label>
                <input type="number" id="q" style="height: 30px;"></input>
            </div>
            <!-- Output N{f} & (p-1).(q-1){a} Here -->
            <h3>Step 2: Derived Number (e)</h3>
            <p>Consider number e as a derived number which should be greater than 1 and less than (p-1) and (q-1). The primary condition will be that there should be no common factor of (p-1) and (q-1) except 1</p>
            <div>
                <label>E : </label>
                <input type="number" id="e" style="height: 30px;"></input>
            </div>
            <h3>Step 3: Public key</h3>
            <p>The specified pair of numbers <b>n</b> and <b>e</b> forms the RSA public key and it is made public.</p>
            <!-- Output Public Key {e}{f} -->
            <h3>Step 4: Private Key</h3>
            <p>Private Key <b>d</b> is calculated from the numbers p, q and e. The mathematical relationship between the numbers is as follows −</p>
            <pre class="">ed = 1 mod (p-1) (q-1)
            </pre>
            <p>The above formula is the basic formula for Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which takes p and q as the input parameters.</p>
            <!-- Output Private Key {d}{f} -->
            <h2>Encryption Formula</h2>
            <p>Consider a sender who sends the plain text message to someone whose public key is <b>(n,e).</b> To encrypt the plain text message in the given scenario, use the following syntax −</p>
            <pre class="">C = Pe mod n
            </pre>
            <div>
                <label>Plaintext : </label>
                <input type="text" id="plain" style="height: 30px;"></input>
            </div>
            <!-- Output plainASCII & cipherASCII & cipher -->
            <h2>Decryption Formula</h2>
            <p>The decryption process is very straightforward and includes analytics for calculation in a systematic approach. Considering receiver<b> C</b> has the private key <b>d</b>, the result modulus will be calculated as −</p>
            <pre class="">Plaintext = Cd mod n
            </pre>
            <!-- Output CipherASCII & plainASCII_decrypt & plain_decrypt -->
